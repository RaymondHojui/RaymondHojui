# 👀I'm Raymond & This is My Profile
**`Data Science & Applied Statistics Programmer`**

Hi, I'm Raymond! I focus on Data Science, and most of my projects are built around working with data, turning it into something useful! I’m currently studying at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) <sub>CA</sub> for [Applied Statistics](http://utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/undergraduate-students/programs/applied-statistics) & [Communication, Culture, Information & Technology (CCIT)](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/iccit/about-iccit/programs/communication-culture-information-technology-ccit). I am interested in all sorts of real-world applications for Data Science & Statistics. I am currently learning about Machine learning and its applications in production.
